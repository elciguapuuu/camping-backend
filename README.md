## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14.x or later recommended)
- MySQL Server (v5.7 or later recommended)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)
- Git

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd camping-backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Database Setup
1. Ensure your MySQL server is running.
2. Create a database named `airbnb_campers` (or the name you specify in your `.env` file).
3. Import the schema from `airbnb_campers.sql` into your database. This file contains the table structures and initial seed data.
   ```bash
   # Example using mysql command line:
   mysql -u your_username -p airbnb_campers < airbnb_campers.sql
   ```

### Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file in the `camping-backend` root directory with the following variables. Replace placeholder values with your actual configuration.
```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your_mysql_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_NAME=airbnb_campers
DB_PORT=3306 # Or your MySQL port

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your_very_strong_jwt_secret # Replace with a long, random string
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1d # Or your preferred expiration time (e.g., 1h, 7d)

# Google OAuth Credentials
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3001/auth/google/callback # Ensure this matches your Google API Console configuration

# Cloudinary Credentials (for image uploads)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret

# Stripe Credentials (for payments)
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_stripe_publishable_key # For client-side
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key # For server-side

# Server Configuration
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development # 'production' or 'development'

# Session Secret (if using sessions, though JWT is primary for API)
SESSION_SECRET=another_strong_secret_for_sessions
```

### Running the Server
```bash
npm nodemon app.js
```
By default, the server will run on `http://localhost:3001` (or the `PORT` specified in your `.env` file).

### Scheduled Tasks
There is a scheduled task for updating booking statuses (e.g., from 'confirmed' to 'completed' after the end date). 
- Script: `scheduled-tasks/updateBookingStatus.js`
- To run manually (or set up with a cron job/task scheduler):
  ```bash
  node scheduled-tasks/updateBookingStatus.js
  ```
- A sample Windows command file `run_update_task.cmd` is provided.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js.
- **MySQL2**: MySQL client for Node.js.
- **Passport.js**: Authentication middleware for Node.js (used for Google OAuth).
- **jsonwebtoken (JWT)**: For creating and verifying JSON Web Tokens for API authentication.
- **bcryptjs**: For hashing passwords.
- **Multer**: Middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, used for file uploads.
- **Cloudinary**: Cloud-based image and video management service.
- **Stripe**: Online payment processing.
- **Dotenv**: For loading environment variables from a `.env` file.
- **Nodemon**: Utility that monitors for changes and automatically restarts the server (for development).

## Usability Notes
- **Authentication**: Most routes require a valid JWT passed in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token.
- **User Roles**: While not explicitly implemented as a granular role system, some routes have implicit ownership checks (e.g., a user can only edit their own locations or bookings).
- **Error Handling**: API responses use standard HTTP status codes. Errors typically return a JSON object with an `error` message and sometimes a `details` field.
- **Soft Deletes**: User accounts are soft-deleted (marked as inactive) to preserve data integrity for associated bookings, reviews, etc.
- **Image Handling**: Images are uploaded to Cloudinary, and their URLs/public IDs are stored in the database.
